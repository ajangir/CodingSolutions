Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of a sequence.

Second line of each test case contains N integers a1,a2,... aN

Output Format:
If it's possible to find any value of ai * aj such that it is a prime number, then print the smallest value of such ai * aj, otherwise print -1.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
1<=a[i]<=100
Examples:
